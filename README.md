# ShopifyMobileChallenge

Author: Brandon Ward

This Kotlin project was created for the Shopify 2019 Summer Internship - Android
The project is a simple store of collections provided from Shopify in the form of JSON

You can download the app-release.apk file to run the app on a virtual or real android device!

Alternatively, download the master and import it into Android Studio to use with your favourite AVD!
